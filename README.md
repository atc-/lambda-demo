# Java 8 Lambda Examples

This project tries to represent as many examples of the JDK 8 Lambda expression featureset. 
Please ensure you've got one of the latest JDK8 Lambda binaries available [here](http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/).

The code is split into a set of sub-packages under jdk8.lambda.demo, all of which are outlined below.

### Collections

### Defaults
Showing off the default method capabilities of interfaces.

### IO
Demonstrates the impact on IO operations when using the various types and lamba expressions, leading to less verbosity in code.

### Parallel
Comparisons between sequential and paralleled algorithms for demonstrating the speed improvements to be had.

### Streams

### Types
Covering Runnable types, Function references and so-on. Also includes an example of the Strategy Pattern using Predicate, Function and the new `stream()` API.
